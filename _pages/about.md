Hello! My name is Chengye Wang, and i am a graduate student at the [School of Mechanical Engneering](https://me.bit.edu.cn/) of 
[Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Assoc.Prof.[Yechen Qin](https://me.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/jlgcx/zdyzskzyjs/sssds3/5ba2e729d2ac4afb866e576ffdd0c7c0.htm).

I got my Bachelor's degree at the [College of Automotive Engneering](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/) of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) under the supervison of Prof.[Nan Xu](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/info/1306/5519.htm) in 2024.

My research interests focus on path planning and stability control of CAVs especially under extreme scenarios. Based on traditional vehicle dynamic method, i am now thrilled to try to apply the advanced technology such as machine learning into improving the motion performance under complex envrionments. 

I am very motivated and passionate about wheeled robot especially the use of learning-based methods. I am now open to PhD positions especially in decions-making and control of autonomous vehicle. Please feel free to reach out!

- **[2025.8]** Our article [“基于动态稳定边界的智能车辆路径跟踪控制方法”](https://leowang1820.github.io/files/2025-0035-revised.pdf)（Dynamic Region of Stability Integrated Path-tracking Control for Intelligent Vehicles）has been accepted by **机械工程学报**（Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering, **IF=4.5, Q1**）！I provide a stable domain estimation method based on Lyapunov function(LF) for the path-tracking controller.
  
- **[2025.7]** Our team designed a Four-wheel independent drive electric vehicle. I designed the architecture of steering, driving and braking modules which can be controlled either via a remote control or manually. Despite weighing only 300kg, we achieved a speed of over 50 km/h and the ability to climb a steep slope of 30°！[Here](https://youtu.be/5dhMFUSSkyM) is part vedio.
  
- **[2025.5]** Our group won the 4th prize in **City and High-Speed Road**, [Onsite Autonomous Driving Algorithm Challenge 2025](https://www.onsite.com.cn/#/dist/home), the part vedio can be seen in [here](https://github.com/Daigo111111/2-Onsite-). 

- **[2024.12]** I completed the dual-vehicle state communication based on Ubuntu/ROS, and this algorithm was used in path planning-related research and we provide a [interesting video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r8RqYJEyP/?vd_source=ae14150a937c3eb3565526f568721c64) based on [BYD,Shenzheng,China](https://www.byd.com/cn) test platfrom. 

- **[2024.9]** I was recommended for admission to Beijing Institute of Technology for graduate studies with the top 5% academic performance at Jilin University.
